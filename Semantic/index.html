            <p> Deaf, not DEAD. People get confused on what Deaf mean - they often think we are dead. No, we are alive and well. Only thing is dead is inside our ears somewhere. <br> <br> <br>We can do anything but hear.<br>

        <h1> The Do's and Don't's</h1>
            <ul>
            <li>
                Don't talk with mouth full of food - we do not want to know what you are eating.</li>
            <li>Don't scream at us - it does not help us understand you any better.</li>
                <li>Do speak a bit slowly - we cannot read lips if you are speaking 100 mph.</li>
            <li>Don't over enunciate - you look funny when you do that.</li>
            
            <li>Do repeat what you said - sometimes we misunderstood what you said for example we may be offended if you said 42.</li>
                <li>Do trim your mustache - it is a little difficult to read lips if your lips are covered. </li>
            </ul>

                <li>tell you later</li>
                <li>not important</li>
                <li>they are stupid - not important </li>
